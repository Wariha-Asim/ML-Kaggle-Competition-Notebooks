# 🚢 Titanic Machine Learning Competition

## 📊 Project Overview
This project predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning algorithms. The solution involves comprehensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and multiple model implementations.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** • **Pandas** • **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn** • **Matplotlib** • **Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 📈 Key Features
### Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values for Age, Fare, Embarked
- Encoded categorical variables (Sex, Embarked)
- Selected relevant features: Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare, Embarked

### Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier

### Evaluation
- Cross-validation with 80/20 split
- Multiple metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Random Forest achieved best performance
